# Hej! I'm Elias and this is my simple, in process portfolio!


Currently, I'm adding my valuable university projects and reflecting on my time at the LEGO Group.
This code, for my portfolio is public because it helps me to practice JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS and so on. 
Apologies for using Tailwind, but it makes web development bearable for me.
